## 🎨 UI/UX Journey
Currently, I design and build UI/UX directly in **Android Studio** using Kotlin.  
I can also **implement Figma designs into Android Studio** and bring them to life through code.  

Right now, I am learning to create **original UI/UX designs in Figma**, and with consistent practice, I will soon master it too. 🚀
